    "## Method 4: reference distribution based on random sampling, internal estimate of  ùúé \n",
    "Let's recall the case study. We have 10 data points for method A and 10 data points for method B.\n",
    "\n",
    "The means are different: 84.24 for method A vs. 85.54 for method B.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reference distribution has 210 data points with a mean of 84.12\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: are 84.24 and 85.54 statistically different based on the reference distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer with method 4, we continue using the assumption that each individual observation is as if obtained by random sampling from a normal population with common standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this time, instead of deriving the standard deviation from the 210 reference data points, we derive it from the sample itself! In real life, we often do not have access to reference set and only have the samples so very important to be able to extract the maximum of information from the samples themselves."
